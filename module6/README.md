module6.cu demonstrates the use of shared, constant, and register memory for executing the Dot Product operation.

The Dot Product operation will serve as the foundation for the platform agnostic, machine learning test bench I wish to develop for this course.

A simple run.sh script has been created to compile and test module6.cu with 5 sample command line inputs. In order to run this script, simply copy the run.sh file and module6.cu file into the same directory, make the run.sh file an executable, and execute the run.sh file (no inputs required).
