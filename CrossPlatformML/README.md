Final Project

The purpose of this project is to develop a CUDA/OpenCL agnostic interface for machine learning algorithms

The first algorithm to be implemented is the k-means algorithm. The first dataset used to test the algorithms is the Iris Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)

The CUDA and OpenCL implementations are aided by existing implementations such as:
https://github.com/andreaferretti/kmeans

To run this application, simply clone this repo, go to this folder, and run "./run.sh". There should be compatitbility with Windows, Mac, and Linux (tested with Mac and Linux).
