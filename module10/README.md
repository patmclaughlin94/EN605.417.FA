HelloWorld.cl contains basic kernel operations that compute addition, subtraction, mutliplication, division and power operations.

HelloWorld.cpp contains host code required to compile and test these kernels.

run.sh is a run file that will compile the whole application and test each basic math operation with different array sizes.
